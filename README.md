# Medical Image Classification ‚Äì Chest X-Ray

## üìå Overview  
This project focuses on **Chest X-ray image classification** to detect **COVID-19** and other lung conditions.  
We implemented and compared three different approaches:  
- A **custom CNN model** built from scratch  
- A **VGG16** model (transfer learning)  
- A **ResNet50** model (transfer learning)  

The workflow includes dataset preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization of results.

## ‚ú® Features  
- Preprocessing of chest X-ray images (resizing, normalization, augmentation)  
- CNN architecture for medical image classification  
- Training and validation with performance tracking  
- Evaluation metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score  
- Confusion matrix and visualization of predictions
